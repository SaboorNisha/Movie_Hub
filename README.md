🎬 #MovieTime-App
MovieTime-App is a simple, interactive movie list application developed as part of my self-learning journey. 
This project showcases my front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add and remove movies from a list dynamically, making it a great hands-on project for managing lists with simple interactions.

🚀 ##Features
Add Movies: Users can add new movies to the list by entering a movie name and clicking the 'Add' button.
Delete Movies: Easily delete movies from the list with a single click on the 'delete' button.
Responsive Design: The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

🛠️ ##Technologies Used
HTML5 for the structure and layout of the app.
CSS3 for styling and ensuring the UI is visually appealing.
JavaScript for handling dynamic interactions such as adding and deleting movies.
