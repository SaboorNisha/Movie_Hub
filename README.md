🎬 MovieTime-App

MovieTime-App is a simple, interactive movie list application developed as part of my self-learning journey. 
This project showcases my front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The app allows users to add and remove movies from a list dynamically, making it a great hands-on project for managing lists with simple interactions.

🚀 Features

✅ Add Movies: Users can add new movies to the list by entering a movie name and clicking the 'Add' button.

❌ Delete Movies: Easily delete movies from the list with a single click on the 'delete' button.

📱 Responsive Design: The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 🌐 for the structure and layout of the app.

CSS3 🎨 for styling and ensuring the UI is visually appealing.

JavaScript ⚙️ for handling dynamic interactions such as adding and deleting movies.
